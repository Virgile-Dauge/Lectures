	shorttitle = {{VICP}},
	abstract = {We propose a novel method to enhance a family of {ICP}(iterative closest point) algorithms by updating velocity. Even though {ICP} algorithms play a dominant role in a model based tracking, it is difficult to avoid an accumulated tracking error during a continuous motion. It is because that typical {ICP} algorithms assumes that each of the point in one scan are measured simultaneously while most of the available rangefinders measure each point sequentially. Hence conventional {ICP} algorithms are prone to be erroneous under a fast motion and an accumulated error during the motion cannot be ignored in many cases. In our approach, we estimate a velocity of a rangefinder numerically over {ICP} iterations. As a result, distortion of a scan due to the motion can be compensated using estimated velocity. In addition, outliers are effectively rejected during the iteration of velocity update, which means that more accurate and robust motion is trackable. Also we verify a performance and an accuracy of our method by demonstrating simulation and real-world experiment results.},

	abstract = {Estimating a vehicles' own trajectory and generating precise maps of the environment are both important tasks for intelligent vehicles. Especially for the second task laser scanners are the sensor of choice as they provide precise range measurements. This work proposes an approach for simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) specifically designed for the Velodyne {HDL}-64E laser scanner which exhibits characteristics not present in most other systems. This comprises the continuous, spinning data acquisition and the relative high sensor noise. Together, these make standard {SLAM} approaches generate noisy maps and inaccurate trajectories. We show that it is possible to generate precise maps and localize therein in spite of not using wheel speed sensors or other information. The presented approach is evaluated on a novel, challenging 3D data set being made publicly available.},
