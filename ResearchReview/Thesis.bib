	abstract = {We propose a novel method to enhance a family of {ICP}(iterative closest point) algorithms by updating velocity. Even though {ICP} algorithms play a dominant role in a model based tracking, it is difficult to avoid an accumulated tracking error during a continuous motion. It is because that typical {ICP} algorithms assumes that each of the point in one scan are measured simultaneously while most of the available rangefinders measure each point sequentially. Hence conventional {ICP} algorithms are prone to be erroneous under a fast motion and an accumulated error during the motion cannot be ignored in many cases. In our approach, we estimate a velocity of a rangefinder numerically over {ICP} iterations. As a result, distortion of a scan due to the motion can be compensated using estimated velocity. In addition, outliers are effectively rejected during the iteration of velocity update, which means that more accurate and robust motion is trackable. Also we verify a performance and an accuracy of our method by demonstrating simulation and real-world experiment results.},

Our system, which we dub {MonoSLAM}, is the first successful application of the {SLAM} methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to structure from motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard {PC} and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which {SLAM} can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas.

	abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) and Visual {SLAM} (V-{SLAM}) in particular have been an active area of research lately. In V-{SLAM} the main focus is most often laid on the localization part of the problem allowing for a drift free motion estimate. To this end, a sparse set of landmarks is tracked and their position is estimated. However, this set of landmarks (rendering the map) is often too sparse for tasks in autonomous driving such as navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance etc. Some methods keep the raw measurements for past robot poses to address the sparsity problem often resulting in a pose only {SLAM} akin to laser scanner {SLAM}. For the stereo case, this is however impractical due to the high noise of stereo reconstructed point clouds. In this paper we propose a dense stereo V-{SLAM} algorithm that estimates a dense 3D map representation which is more accurate than raw stereo measurements. Thereto, we run a sparse V {SLAM} system, take the resulting pose estimates to compute a locally dense representation from dense stereo correspondences. This dense representation is expressed in local coordinate systems which are tracked as part of the {SLAM} estimate. This allows the dense part to be continuously updated. Our system is driven by visual odometry priors to achieve high robustness when tracking landmarks. Moreover, the sparse part of the {SLAM} system uses recently published sub mapping techniques to achieve constant runtime complexity most of the time. The improved accuracy over raw stereo measurements is shown in a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by presenting outdoor experiments of a car like robot.},

Building on excellent algorithms of recent years, we designed from scratch a novel system that uses the same features for all {SLAM} tasks: tracking, mapping, relocalization, and loop closing. A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation.

	abstract = {We present a new parametrization for point features within monocular simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) that permits efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within the standard extended Kalman filter ({EKF}). The key concept is direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features relative to the camera locations from which they were first viewed, which produces measurement equations with a high degree of linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope with features over a huge range of depths, even those that are so far from the camera that they present little parallax during motion—maintaining sufficient representative uncertainty that these points retain the opportunity to "come in” smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense that even distant features are immediately used to improve camera motion estimates, acting initially as bearing references but not permanently labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization remains well behaved for features at all stages of {SLAM} processing, but has the drawback in computational terms that each point is represented by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard three of a Euclidean {XYZ} representation. We show that once the depth estimate of a feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation can safely be converted to the Euclidean {XYZ} form, and propose a linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion to maintain maximum efficiency—only low parallax features need be maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We present a real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization is validated in a fully automatic 3-D {SLAM} system featuring a handheld single camera with no additional sensing. Experiments show robust operation in challenging indoor and outdoor environments with a very large ranges of scene depth, varied motion, and als- - o real time 360deg loop closing.},

Then, scan matching based lidar odometry refines the motion estimation and point cloud registration simultaneously.We show results with datasets collected in our own experiments as well as using the {KITTI} odometry benchmark. Our proposed method is ranked \#1 on the benchmark in terms of average translation and rotation errors, with a 0.75\% of relative position drift.

In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to address the loop closure problem in large-scale laser-{SLAMs}, where both laser and camera sensors are integrated. {ORB} features and bags-of-word were applied to obtain fast and robust performance of loop detection. The well-recognized {LRGC} {SLAM} framework and {SPA} optimization algorithm were then used to achieve the {SLAM}. Finally, several experiments in different large-scale environments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We are inspired by the notion of a manifold, which takes maps out of the two-dimensional plane and onto a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The key advantage of the manifold representation is self-consistency: when closing loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the "cross over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of important capabilities, including autonomous exploration, search, and retro-traverse. It also supports a very robust form of loop closure, in which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm or reject possible correspondence points. In this paper, we develop the basic formalism of the manifold representation, show how this may be applied to the multirobot simultaneous localization and mapping problem, and present experimental results obtained from teams of up to four robots in environments ranging in size from 400 to 900 m2},

Commonly, solutions based on scan-matching algorithms are applied. In contrast to these approaches, we propose to use a particle filter transferring the concept of the 2D Rao-Blackwellized particle filter {SLAM} to 3D. As filter input, 3D laser range data and odometry readings are obtained while the robot is in motion. The ground plane is estimated based on previously built map parts, thereby approaching the problem that not all degrees of freedom are covered by the odometry. To gain control of the high memory requirements for the particles' 3D map representations, we introduce a memory efficient search structure and adapt a technique to efficiently organize and share maps between particles. We evaluate our approach based on experimental results obtained by simulation as well as measurements of a real robot system.},

The structure of mentioned inertial {SLAM} algorithm is appropriate for application in both the Range/Bearing and Bearing-only inertial sensors. This algorithm is independent of any external positioning information such as global positioning system ({GPS}) or any prepared data of terrain sensors. This work proposes a perfect system that improves the efficiency and accuracy of 3D inertial {SLAM} and over comes two main problems that less consideration is available about them in previous researches. First, it considers all of freedom degrees such as altitude, the latitude and longitude for {UAV}. Second, the algorithm based on inertial sensors is able to observe all of landmarks in various heights. Finally, using real flight data, the proposed algorithm is tested and the results showed desired performance of the algorithm for inertial system.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles require the ability to build maps of an unknown environment while concurrently using these maps for navigation. Current algorithms for this concurrent mapping and localization ({CML}) problem have been implemented for single vehicles, but do not account for extra positional information available when multiple vehicles operate simultaneously. Multiple vehicles have the potential to map an environment more quickly and robustly than a single vehicle. This paper presents a cooperative {CML} algorithm that merges sensor and navigation information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The algorithm presented is based on stochastic estimation and uses a feature-based approach to extract landmarks from the environment. The theoretical framework for the collaborative {CML} algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem central to the cooperative {CML} problem. is proved for the first time. This theorem quantifies the performance gains of collaboration, allowing for determination of the number of cooperating vehicles required to accomplish a task. A simulated implementation of the collaborative {CML} algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvement over non-cooperative {CML}.},

	abstract = {The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) problem for mobile robots aims at consistently building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously determining its position or location within this map. From a control-theory viewpoint, it is somehow analogous to simultaneously estimating the states and output map of the system. In the robotic based engineering applications, {SLAM} is arguably considered a solved problem on a theoretical and conceptual level, but still it requires considerable maturity on a practical level [16][22]. The state-of-the-art {SLAM} algorithms require computationally powerful processors, expensive sensors with dense feature extraction and multiple sensors for uncertainty reduction [21]. An approach to the {SLAM} problem using minimal sensing information is still lacking in both theoretical and practical aspects. This paper highlights the data acquisition \& association issues with different sensors like odometric \& infra red sensors used in {SLAM} application due to addition of random Gaussian noise leading to errors \& uncertainty in mapping processes [17][22]. Simple filtering techniques using average filtering \& Kalman filtering have been implemented on the acquired data to go for comparative analysis of sensor performance \& its impact on {SLAM} process towards reduction in uncertainty or minimal shift in landmark extraction [19].},

	abstract = {Estimating a vehicles' own trajectory and generating precise maps of the environment are both important tasks for intelligent vehicles. Especially for the second task laser scanners are the sensor of choice as they provide precise range measurements. This work proposes an approach for simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) specifically designed for the Velodyne {HDL}-64E laser scanner which exhibits characteristics not present in most other systems. This comprises the continuous, spinning data acquisition and the relative high sensor noise. Together, these make standard {SLAM} approaches generate noisy maps and inaccurate trajectories. We show that it is possible to generate precise maps and localize therein in spite of not using wheel speed sensors or other information. The presented approach is evaluated on a novel, challenging 3D data set being made publicly available.},

While new {SLAM} systems are being proposed at every conference, evaluation is often restricted to qualitative visualizations or accuracy estimation against a ground truth. This is due to the lack of benchmarking methodologies which can holistically and quantitatively evaluate these systems. Further investigation at the level of individual kernels and parameter spaces of {SLAM} pipelines is non-existent, which is absolutely essential for systems research and integration. We extend the recently introduced {SLAMBench} framework to allow comparing two state-of-the-art {SLAM} pipelines, namely {KinectFusion} and {LSD}-{SLAM}, along the metrics of accuracy, energy consumption, and processing frame rate on two different hardware platforms, namely a desktop and an embedded device. We also analyze the pipelines at the level of individual kernels and explore their algorithmic and hardware design spaces for the first time, yielding valuable insights.},

	abstract = {Rigid registration of two geometric data sets is essential in many applications, including robot navigation, surface reconstruction, and shape matching. Most commonly, variants of the Iterative Closest Point ({ICP}) algorithm are employed for this task. These methods alternate between closest point computations to establish correspondences between two data sets, and solving for the optimal transformation that brings these correspondences into alignment. A major difficulty for this approach is the sensitivity to outliers and missing data often observed in 3D scans. Most practical implementations of the {ICP} algorithm address this issue with a number of heuristics to prune or reweight correspondences. However, these heuristics can be unreliable and difficult to tune, which often requires substantial manual assistance. We propose a new formulation of the {ICP} algorithm that avoids these difficulties by formulating the registration optimization using sparsity inducing norms. Our new algorithm retains the simple structure of the {ICP} algorithm, while achieving superior registration results when dealing with outliers and incomplete data. The complete source code of our implementation is provided at http://lgg.epfl.ch/sparseicp.},

We introduce the anti-factor as a means to subtract information in graphical {SLAM} systems, and illustrate its use to both replace information in an incremental solver and to cancel out neighborhood information from shared summarized maps.

	abstract = {We propose a multi-robot exploration algorithm that uses adaptive coordination to provide heterogeneous behavior. The key idea is to maximize the efficiency of exploring and mapping an unknown environment when a team is faced with unreliable communication and limited battery life (e.g., with aerial rotorcraft). The proposed algorithm utilizes four states: explore, meet, sacrifice, and relay. The explore state uses a frontier-based exploration algorithm, the meet state returns to the last known location of communication to share data, the sacrifice state sends the robot out to explore without consideration of remaining battery, and the relay state lands the robot until a meeting occurs. This approach allows robots to take on the role of a relay to improve communication between team members. In addition, the robots can “sacrifice” themselves by continuing to explore even when they do not have sufficient battery to return to the base station. We compare the performance of the proposed approach to state-of-the-art frontier-based exploration, and results show gains in explored area. The feasibility of components of the proposed approach is also demonstrated on a team of two custom-built quadcopters exploring an office environment.},

	abstract = {Large scale, long-term, distributed mapping is a core challenge to modern field robotics. Using the sensory output of multiple robots and fusing it in an efficient way enables the creation of globally accurate and consistent metric maps. To combine data from multiple agents into a global map, most existing approaches use a central entity that collects and manages the information from all agents. Often, the raw sensor data of one robot needs to be made available to processing algorithms on other agents due to the lack of computational resources on that robot. Unfortunately, network latency and low bandwidth in the field limit the generality of such an approach and make multi-robot map building a tedious task. In this paper, we present a distributed and decentralized back-end for concurrent and consistent robotic mapping. We propose a set of novel approaches that reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the effectiveness of inter-robot communication for distributed mapping. Instead of locking access to the map during operations, we define a version control system which allows concurrent and consistent access to the map data. Updates to the map are then shared asynchronously with agents which previously registered notifications. A technique for data lookup is provided by state-of-the-art algorithms from distributed computing. We validate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The mobile robots have heterogeneous sensing capabilities, with some having high quality inertial and exteroceptive sensing, while others have only low quality sensing or none at all. By sharing information, a combined estimate of all robot poses is obtained. Inter-robot range-bearing measurements provide the mechanism for transferring pose information from well-localised vehicles to those less capable. In our proposed formulation, high frequency egocentric data (e.g., odometry, {IMU}, {GPS}) is fused locally on each platform. This is the distributed part of the algorithm. Inter-robot measurements, and accompanying state estimates, are communicated to a central server, which generates an optimal minimum mean-squared estimate of all robot poses. This server is easily duplicated for full redundant decentralisation. Communication and computation are efficient due to the sparseness properties of the information-form Gaussian representation. A team of three indoor mobile robots equipped with lasers, odometry and inertial sensing provides experimental verification of the algorithms effectiveness in combining location information.},

	abstract = {In cooperative navigation, teams of mobile robots obtain range and/or angle measurements to each other and dead-reckoning information to help each other navigate more accurately. One typical approach is moving baseline navigation, in which multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ({AUVs}) exchange range measurements using acoustic modems to perform mobile trilateration. While the sharing of information between vehicles can be highly beneficial, exchanging measurements and state estimates can also be dangerous because of the risk of measurements being used by a vehicle more than once; such data re-use leads to inconsistent (overconfident) estimates, making data association and outlier rejection more difficult and divergence more likely. In this paper, we present a technique for the consistent cooperative localization of multiple {AUVs} performing mobile trilateration. Each {AUV} establishes a bank of filters, performing careful bookkeeping to track the origins of measurements and prevent the use any of the measurements more than once. The multiple estimates are combined in a consistent manner, yielding conservative covariance estimates. The technique is illustrated using simulation results. The new method is compared side-by-side with a naive approach that does not keep track of the origins of measurements, illustrating that the new method keeps conservative covariance bounds whereas state estimates obtained with the naive approach become overconfident and diverge.},

This method enables a team of robots to build joint maps with or without initial knowledge of their relative poses. To accomplish the simultaneous localization and mapping this method uses square root information smoothing ({SRIS}). In contrast to traditional extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) methods the smoothing does not exclude any information and is therefore also better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models. The method proposed does not require the collaborative robots to have initial correspondence. The key contribution of this work is an optimal smoothing algorithm for merging maps that are created by different robots independently or in groups. The method not only joins maps from different robots, it also recovers the complete robot trajectory for each robot involved in the map joining. It is also shown how data association between duplicate features is done and how this reduces uncertainty in the complete map. Two simulated scenarios are presented where the C-{SAM} algorithm is applied on two individually created maps. One basically joins two maps resulting in a large map while the other shows a scenario where sensor extension is carried out.},

Recent pose graph representations have proven very successful for single robot mapping and localization. Among these methods, incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}) gives an exact incremental solution to the {SLAM} problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel extension to {iSAM} to facilitate online multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose graphs. Our main contribution is a relative formulation of the relationship between multiple pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem and leads to an efficient solution when compared to a completely global formulation. The relative pose graphs are optimized together to provide a globally consistent multi-robot solution. Efficient access to covariances at any time for relative parameters is provided through {iSAM}, facilitating data association and loop closing. The performance of the technique is illustrated on various data sets including a publicly available multi-robot data set. Further evaluation is performed in a collaborative helicopter and ground robot experiment.},

	abstract = {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping ({SLAM}) framework. As team coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and large scale {SLAM} increasing both efficiency and robustness of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters ({RBPF}) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the problem of single robot {SLAM}, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present paper we address the problem of multi robot {SLAM} in the case of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses. Starting from the well established single robot {RBPF}-{SLAM}, we propose a simple technique which jointly estimates {SLAM} posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended to different communication technologies (bluetooth, {RFId}, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range. The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.},

We show that the original {SLAM} graph can be recursively partitioned into multiple-level submaps using the nested dissection algorithm, which leads to the cluster tree, a powerful graph representation. By employing the nested dissection algorithm, our algorithm greatly minimizes the dependencies between two subtrees, and the optimization of the original {SLAM} graph can be done using a bottom-up inference along the corresponding cluster tree. To speed up the computation, we also introduce a base node for each submap and use it to represent the rigid transformation of the submap in the global coordinate frame. As a result, the optimization moves the base nodes rather than the actual submap variables. We demonstrate that our algorithm is not only exact but also much faster than alternative approaches in both simulations and real-world experiments.},

We prove that in the new model it is more efficient to sample data from a smaller numbers of groups and groups with more tentative correspondences, which leads to a new sampling procedure that uses progressive numbers of groups. We demonstrate our algorithm on two classical geometric vision problems: wide-baseline matching and camera resectioning. The experiments show that the algorithm serves as a general framework that works well with three possible grouping strategies investigated in this paper, including a novel optical flow based clustering approach. The results show that our algorithm is able to achieve a significant performance gain compared to the standard {RANSAC} and {PROSAC}.},

Under the mild assumption that the similarity measure predicts correctness of a match better than random guessing, we show that {PROSAC} achieves large computational savings. Experiments demonstrate it is often significantly faster (up to more than hundred times) than {RANSAC}.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}), which is a novel approach to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem that is based on fast incremental matrix factorization. {iSAM} provides an efficient and exact solution by updating a {QR} factorization of the naturally sparse smoothing information matrix, thereby recalculating only those matrix entries that actually change. {iSAM} is efficient even for robot trajectories with many loops as it avoids unnecessary fill-in in the factor matrix by periodic variable reordering. Also, to enable data association in real time, we provide efficient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix. We systematically evaluate the different components of {iSAM} as well as the overall algorithm using various simulated and real-world datasets for both landmark and pose-only settings.},

Application domains include robotics, wearable computing, augmented reality, and automotive. The term {VO} was coined in 2004 by Nister in his landmark paper. The term was chosen for its similarity to wheel odometry, which incrementally estimates the motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time. Likewise, {VO} operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras. For {VO} to work effectively, there should be sufficient illumination in the environment and a static scene with enough texture to allow apparent motion to be extracted. Furthermore, consecutive frames should be captured by ensuring that they have sufficient scene overlap.},

The richness of their data and the recent development of low-cost sensors have combined to present an attractive opportunity for mobile robotics research. In this paper, we describe a system for visual odometry and mapping using an {RGB}-D camera, and its application to autonomous flight. By leveraging results from recent state-of-the-art algorithms and hardware, our system enables 3D flight in cluttered environments using only onboard sensor data. All computation and sensing required for local position control are performed onboard the vehicle, reducing the dependence on unreliable wireless links. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system for stabilizing and controlling a quadrotor micro air vehicle, demonstrate its use for constructing detailed 3D maps of an indoor environment, and discuss its limitations.},

	abstract = {We present a system that estimates the motion of a stereo head or a single moving camera based on video input. The system operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources such as {GPS}, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated purely from images over previously unseen distances and periods of time.},

Moreover, we do not make any assumption on the noise present in the sensor data and have no constraints on the estimated rigid transformation. The source code of our implementation is made publicly available, which can be adapted to work for {ICP} with different error metrics with minor changes. Our preliminary results show that {ICP}'s covariance is lower at a global minimum than at a local minima.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for estimating the covariance of the {ICP} (iterative closest/corresponding point) algorithm are either inaccurate or are computationally too expensive to be used online. This paper proposes a new method, based on the analysis of the error function being minimized. It considers that the correspondences are not independent (the same measurement being used in more than one correspondence), and explicitly utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, which are not assumed to be independent either. The validity of the approach is verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate than previous methods and its computational load is negligible. The ill-posedness of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled for under-constrained situations by performing an observability analysis; in the analyzed cases the method still provides a good estimate of the error projected on the observable manifold.},
