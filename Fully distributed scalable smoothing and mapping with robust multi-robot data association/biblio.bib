	abstract = {This paper describes a novel representation for two-dimensional maps, and shows how this representation may be applied to the problem of multirobot simultaneous localization and mapping. We are inspired by the notion of a manifold, which takes maps out of the two-dimensional plane and onto a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The key advantage of the manifold representation is self-consistency: when closing loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the "cross over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of important capabilities, including autonomous exploration, search, and retro-traverse. It also supports a very robust form of loop closure, in which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm or reject possible correspondence points. In this paper, we develop the basic formalism of the manifold representation, show how this may be applied to the multirobot simultaneous localization and mapping problem, and present experimental results obtained from teams of up to four robots in environments ranging in size from 400 to 900 m2},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles require the ability to build maps of an unknown environment while concurrently using these maps for navigation. Current algorithms for this concurrent mapping and localization ({CML}) problem have been implemented for single vehicles, but do not account for extra positional information available when multiple vehicles operate simultaneously. Multiple vehicles have the potential to map an environment more quickly and robustly than a single vehicle. This paper presents a cooperative {CML} algorithm that merges sensor and navigation information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The algorithm presented is based on stochastic estimation and uses a feature-based approach to extract landmarks from the environment. The theoretical framework for the collaborative {CML} algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem central to the cooperative {CML} problem. is proved for the first time. This theorem quantifies the performance gains of collaboration, allowing for determination of the number of cooperating vehicles required to accomplish a task. A simulated implementation of the collaborative {CML} algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvement over non-cooperative {CML}.},

	abstract = {We propose a multi-robot exploration algorithm that uses adaptive coordination to provide heterogeneous behavior. The key idea is to maximize the efficiency of exploring and mapping an unknown environment when a team is faced with unreliable communication and limited battery life (e.g., with aerial rotorcraft). The proposed algorithm utilizes four states: explore, meet, sacrifice, and relay. The explore state uses a frontier-based exploration algorithm, the meet state returns to the last known location of communication to share data, the sacrifice state sends the robot out to explore without consideration of remaining battery, and the relay state lands the robot until a meeting occurs. This approach allows robots to take on the role of a relay to improve communication between team members. In addition, the robots can “sacrifice” themselves by continuing to explore even when they do not have sufficient battery to return to the base station. We compare the performance of the proposed approach to state-of-the-art frontier-based exploration, and results show gains in explored area. The feasibility of components of the proposed approach is also demonstrated on a team of two custom-built quadcopters exploring an office environment.},

	abstract = {Large scale, long-term, distributed mapping is a core challenge to modern field robotics. Using the sensory output of multiple robots and fusing it in an efficient way enables the creation of globally accurate and consistent metric maps. To combine data from multiple agents into a global map, most existing approaches use a central entity that collects and manages the information from all agents. Often, the raw sensor data of one robot needs to be made available to processing algorithms on other agents due to the lack of computational resources on that robot. Unfortunately, network latency and low bandwidth in the field limit the generality of such an approach and make multi-robot map building a tedious task. In this paper, we present a distributed and decentralized back-end for concurrent and consistent robotic mapping. We propose a set of novel approaches that reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the effectiveness of inter-robot communication for distributed mapping. Instead of locking access to the map during operations, we define a version control system which allows concurrent and consistent access to the map data. Updates to the map are then shared asynchronously with agents which previously registered notifications. A technique for data lookup is provided by state-of-the-art algorithms from distributed computing. We validate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The mobile robots have heterogeneous sensing capabilities, with some having high quality inertial and exteroceptive sensing, while others have only low quality sensing or none at all. By sharing information, a combined estimate of all robot poses is obtained. Inter-robot range-bearing measurements provide the mechanism for transferring pose information from well-localised vehicles to those less capable. In our proposed formulation, high frequency egocentric data (e.g., odometry, {IMU}, {GPS}) is fused locally on each platform. This is the distributed part of the algorithm. Inter-robot measurements, and accompanying state estimates, are communicated to a central server, which generates an optimal minimum mean-squared estimate of all robot poses. This server is easily duplicated for full redundant decentralisation. Communication and computation are efficient due to the sparseness properties of the information-form Gaussian representation. A team of three indoor mobile robots equipped with lasers, odometry and inertial sensing provides experimental verification of the algorithms effectiveness in combining location information.},

	abstract = {In cooperative navigation, teams of mobile robots obtain range and/or angle measurements to each other and dead-reckoning information to help each other navigate more accurately. One typical approach is moving baseline navigation, in which multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ({AUVs}) exchange range measurements using acoustic modems to perform mobile trilateration. While the sharing of information between vehicles can be highly beneficial, exchanging measurements and state estimates can also be dangerous because of the risk of measurements being used by a vehicle more than once; such data re-use leads to inconsistent (overconfident) estimates, making data association and outlier rejection more difficult and divergence more likely. In this paper, we present a technique for the consistent cooperative localization of multiple {AUVs} performing mobile trilateration. Each {AUV} establishes a bank of filters, performing careful bookkeeping to track the origins of measurements and prevent the use any of the measurements more than once. The multiple estimates are combined in a consistent manner, yielding conservative covariance estimates. The technique is illustrated using simulation results. The new method is compared side-by-side with a naive approach that does not keep track of the origins of measurements, illustrating that the new method keeps conservative covariance bounds whereas state estimates obtained with the naive approach become overconfident and diverge.},

This method enables a team of robots to build joint maps with or without initial knowledge of their relative poses. To accomplish the simultaneous localization and mapping this method uses square root information smoothing ({SRIS}). In contrast to traditional extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) methods the smoothing does not exclude any information and is therefore also better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models. The method proposed does not require the collaborative robots to have initial correspondence. The key contribution of this work is an optimal smoothing algorithm for merging maps that are created by different robots independently or in groups. The method not only joins maps from different robots, it also recovers the complete robot trajectory for each robot involved in the map joining. It is also shown how data association between duplicate features is done and how this reduces uncertainty in the complete map. Two simulated scenarios are presented where the C-{SAM} algorithm is applied on two individually created maps. One basically joins two maps resulting in a large map while the other shows a scenario where sensor extension is carried out.},

Recent pose graph representations have proven very successful for single robot mapping and localization. Among these methods, incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}) gives an exact incremental solution to the {SLAM} problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel extension to {iSAM} to facilitate online multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose graphs. Our main contribution is a relative formulation of the relationship between multiple pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem and leads to an efficient solution when compared to a completely global formulation. The relative pose graphs are optimized together to provide a globally consistent multi-robot solution. Efficient access to covariances at any time for relative parameters is provided through {iSAM}, facilitating data association and loop closing. The performance of the technique is illustrated on various data sets including a publicly available multi-robot data set.

	doi = {10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509307},
	abstract = {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping ({SLAM}) framework. As team coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and large scale {SLAM} increasing both efficiency and robustness of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters ({RBPF}) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the problem of single robot {SLAM}, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present paper we address the problem of multi robot {SLAM} in the case of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses. Starting from the well established single robot {RBPF}-{SLAM}, we propose a simple technique which jointly estimates {SLAM} posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended to different communication technologies (bluetooth, {RFId}, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range. The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel batch algorithm for {SLAM} problems that distributes the workload in a hierarchical way. We show that the original {SLAM} graph can be recursively partitioned into multiple-level submaps using the nested dissection algorithm, which leads to the cluster tree, a powerful graph representation. By employing the nested dissection algorithm, our algorithm greatly minimizes the dependencies between two subtrees, and the optimization of the original {SLAM} graph can be done using a bottom-up inference along the corresponding cluster tree. To speed up the computation, we also introduce a base node for each submap and use it to represent the rigid transformation of the submap in the global coordinate frame. As a result, the optimization moves the base nodes rather than the actual submap variables. We demonstrate that our algorithm is not only exact but also much faster than alternative approaches in both simulations and real-world experiments.},

We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions},

	abstract = {We present a novel variant of the {RANSAC} algorithm that is much more efficient, in particular when dealing with problems with low inlier ratios. Our algorithm assumes that there exists some grouping in the data, based on which we introduce a new binomial mixture model rather than the simple binomial model as used in {RANSAC}. We prove that in the new model it is more efficient to sample data from a smaller numbers of groups and groups with more tentative correspondences, which leads to a new sampling procedure that uses progressive numbers of groups. We demonstrate our algorithm on two classical geometric vision problems: wide-baseline matching and camera resectioning. The experiments show that the algorithm serves as a general framework that works well with three possible grouping strategies investigated in this paper, including a novel optical flow based clustering approach. The results show that our algorithm is able to achieve a significant performance gain compared to the standard {RANSAC} and {PROSAC}.},

	abstract = {A new robust matching method is proposed. The progressive sample consensus ({PROSAC}) algorithm exploits the linear ordering defined on the set of correspondences by a similarity function used in establishing tentative correspondences. Unlike {RANSAC}, which treats all correspondences equally and draws random samples uniformly from the full set, {PROSAC} samples are drawn from progressively larger sets of top-ranked correspondences. Under the mild assumption that the similarity measure predicts correctness of a match better than random guessing, we show that {PROSAC} achieves large computational savings. Experiments demonstrate it is often significantly faster (up to more than hundred times) than {RANSAC}. For the derived size of the sampled set of correspondences as a function of the number of samples already drawn, {PROSAC} converges towards {RANSAC} in the worst case. The power of the method is demonstrated on wide-baseline matching problems.},

Also, to enable data association in real time, we provide efficient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix.
